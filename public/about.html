<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Abdul Wali, a dedicated and passionate Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Dallas, with a strong 
foundation in software development and quality assurance. My journey in tech has led me to specialize in automation testing, 
where I've honed my skills in various testing tools and frameworks, including Selenium, JUnit, and Cucumber. I have hands-on 
experience working with cloud platforms like AWS and containerization tools such as Docker.</p>

<p>Currently, I serve as a Software Development Engineer in Test, where I contribute to ensuring the robustness of web applications
through data-driven and behavior-driven testing methodologies. My role allows me to work closely with developers, guiding junior
testers, and maintaining automation frameworks that enhance testing efficiency and accuracy.</p>

<p>Beyond my technical expertise, I’m also actively involved in leadership roles, serving as the Director of the PSA UTD Chapter. 
Here, I lead a team to organize large-scale events, demonstrating my ability to manage and coordinate complex projects effectively.</p>

<p>Driven by a love for technology and a commitment to continuous learning, I’m always exploring new challenges and opportunities to 
expand my skills in software engineering and project management.</p>
